# States-Map-Game
Map-based board game using Python Turtle objects
Board game that takes input from user, then correlates it with data in a csv file. If it matches, a flag(Turtle object) is planted on the gameboard at the (x,y) values dictated in the csv. When user closes the program, a csv file is created (for educational purposes) showing which states the user failed to guess correctly.
